0MQ version 2.2.0 (beta), released on 2011/09/xx
================================================

Bug fixes
---------

Changes
-------

* Duplicate identities now checked at connection time. A peer using a
  duplicate identity is disconnected and will retry after the
  ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL, with backoff strategy.

* System error reporting bus, sys://log introduced.

* Duplicate identities are logged to sys://log.

* ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE socket option added. This allows the node to guard
  against peers sending oversized messages. If a peer sends an oversized
  message, the connection to that peer is dropped.

Also includes all bug fixes and changes in 2.1.x.
